          <h1>Information about recycling</h1>
          <p class="description">
            Residents and businesses with city waste collection service can recycle using their blue roll cart.  If you do not have a blue recycling roll cart, request one by calling LexCall at 311 or online.

            Residents who do not receive city waste collection service can recycle using one of the drop-off recycling containers located throughout Lexington.  Material disposed of using either a blue roll cart or drop-off container should be loose, not bagged.

            As is the case with all carts, your blue recycling cart should be placed on the curb no earlier than 4 p.m. the day before your collection and no later than 5 a.m. on the day of your collection. Carts must be removed from the curb by 7 p.m. on your collection day. Find your collection day.

            Excess cardboard may be placed at the curb near your carts on your regular collection day. Boxes must be empty, flattened and tied or bundled.
